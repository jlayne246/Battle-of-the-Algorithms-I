# This is the Player 2 AI controller file.
# You can implement your snake AI logic here to test playing against an opponent.
# This is useful for developing and debugging your Player 1 AI.
#
# Similar to Player 1, you will need to implement:
# 1. `get_next_move(board_state_data, player_state_data, opponent_state_data)`
# 2. `set_player_name()`
#
# Refer to `docs/controller_api.md` for more details.
# Good Luck!

    A very basic snake controller. It always tries to move right, unless
    that's not a safe move, in which case it tries down, then up, then left.
    If none of those are safe, it returns the current direction.

    This example uses the game's GRID_SIZE for all moves and checks, ensuring
    compatibility regardless of the configured grid.
